# Water Pump

There are many different types of water pumps. Almost all of which will need an intermediate circuit (something between the pump and the arduino). You may choose a few of the following intermediate circuits:
- 5V Relay module (Lesson 30)
- Transistor + Resistor circuit (Example in link below)

# Do NOT plug the motor directly into the arduino!
