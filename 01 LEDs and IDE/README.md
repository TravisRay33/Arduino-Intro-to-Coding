# Circuit 01 LEDs and IDE

## Overview:
This first lesson will familiarize you with the Arduino board and software. Your will need the following Supplies:

- Arduino
- Breadbord
- Laptop Computer
- USB connector
- LEDs
- 330 Ohm Resistors (Orange-Orange-Brown)
- Jumper Wires

# Circuit Play
The circuit play section will have you fiddle and play with the physical circuit in various ways. The goal is to determine if and how the changes affects the functionality of the circuit.

1. What happens if you disconnect any wires?
2. What happens if you reverse the polarity of the LED (plug it in backwards)?
3. What happens if you move the green wire from port 13 to port 12?

# Code Play
The code play section will have you fiddle and play with the code in various ways. The goal is to determine what each change does and, ultimately, how to have complete control of your circuit. Some changes will 'break' your code and it will show an error when you compile, other changes will affect how the code functions. 

1.	In the last activity you moved the green wire to port 12. What do you need to change in the code to utilize port 12?
2.	What happens if you change the delay codes from delay(1000) to delay(2000)?
3.	What happens if you place a // before void setup()?
4.	What happens if you place a // before void loop()?
5.	What happens if you remove one of the curly brace “}” from the code?
6.	What happens if you change HIGH to lowercase high? Is the program case sensitive?

# Challenges
The challenges section will include several small challenges for you to accomplish

1. Add a second LED, let's us a yellow one, program both LEDs to flash at the same time.
2. Modify your code so that the LEDs flash in sequence (i.e. Red-Yellow-Red-Yellow).

# Mini Project
The mini project section will stretch your skills to model a real-world object or tool. For this project, create a model version of a stoplight.
